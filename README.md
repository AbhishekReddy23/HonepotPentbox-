🐝Honeypot with Pentbox on Kali Linux
Welcome to my comprehensive Pentbox Honeypot project! This guide demonstrates how to set up and use Pentbox on Kali Linux to create honeypots for network security testing and cybersecurity education.

Pentbox Project Overview

🛠️ What is Pentbox?
Pentbox is a Ruby-based security testing tool designed specifically for Kali Linux. It provides a comprehensive penetration testing framework that helps identify vulnerabilities in networks and systems through various security testing modules including:

Network Tools for reconnaissance and honeypot deployment

Cryptography Tools for hashing, encryption, and password analysis

System Utilities for performance monitoring and analysis

Pentbox Main Interface

🎯 Why Use Pentbox and Honeypots?
Honeypots are decoy systems strategically deployed to attract and analyze attacker behavior. They serve multiple critical security purposes:

🕵️‍♂️ Attack Analysis: Reveal how hackers attempt to breach systems and what techniques they use

🛡️ Vulnerability Assessment: Help identify and fix security weaknesses in your actual network infrastructure

🎯 Threat Diversion: Distract attackers from your main production systems while gathering intelligence

📊 Security Intelligence: Collect valuable data about attack patterns and malicious activities

📝 Prerequisites
Before getting started with this project, ensure you have the following components ready:

🖥️ VirtualBox - For creating and managing virtual machine environments

🐧 Kali Linux - The primary operating system for this security testing setup

💎 Pentbox - The main security testing framework (we'll download this together)

🌐 Network Access - For testing network-based security features

📦 Download and Install Pentbox on Kali Linux

🧭 Using Network Tools
🔎 TCP Port Scanner Implementation
The TCP Port Scanner is one of Pentbox's most useful reconnaissance tools for identifying open ports and services:

Steps to use the Port Scanner:

Navigate to Network Tools menu

Select TCP Port Scanner option

Enter target IP address or hostname

Review the scan results for open ports and services

TCP Port Scanner Interface

🐝 Honeypot Configuration
Pentbox offers flexible honeypot deployment options:

Fast Auto Configuration:

Automatically sets up honeypot on port 80

Uses default warning messages

Enables basic logging functionality

Manual Configuration:

Choose custom port numbers

Set personalized warning messages

Configure detailed logging options

Enable advanced monitoring features

The honeypot effectively captures malicious activity and denies access while logging attempts for analysis.

🔐 Cryptography Tools in Action
🧩 Multi-Digest Hashing Tools
Pentbox provides robust hashing capabilities for data integrity verification and security analysis:

Hashing Tools Interface

Supported Algorithms:

MD5 (Message Digest Algorithm 5)

SHA1 (Secure Hash Algorithm 1)

SHA256 (Secure Hash Algorithm 256-bit)

SHA384 (Secure Hash Algorithm 384-bit)

SHA512 (Secure Hash Algorithm 512-bit)

RIPEMD-160 (RACE Integrity Primitives Evaluation Message Digest)

Using Hashing Tools:

Navigate to Cryptography Tools menu

Select Hashing Tools option

Choose your preferred algorithm

Input the data you want to hash

Receive the computed hash value

🗝️ Password Analysis Module
The password cracking feature allows for dictionary-based password analysis:

Password Cracking Configuration

Password Cracking Process:

Navigate to Cryptography Tools menu

Select Password Cracking option

Provide a wordlist file for dictionary attacks

Input the target hash to crack

Monitor the cracking progress and results

📝 Text Encryption Features
Secure text encryption and decryption capabilities for protecting sensitive information:

Text Encryption Interface

Text Encryption Process:

Navigate to Cryptography Tools menu

Select Text Encryption option

Input your text and encryption key

Choose between encryption or decryption mode

Receive the processed output

🧪 Testing and Validation
🐝 Honeypot Testing Methodology
To properly test your honeypot configuration and validate its effectiveness:

Honeypot Testing Results

Testing Steps:

Configure the Honeypot: Set up using either fast or manual configuration

Simulate Attacks: Use a web browser or Telnet client to access the honeypot IP

Monitor Detection: Watch the Kali terminal for real-time intrusion alerts

Analyze Logs: Review captured data for attack patterns and techniques

Validate Response: Ensure proper "Access Denied" responses are displayed

Expected Results:

Browser displays "Access Denied" message when accessing honeypot

Terminal shows "INTRUSION ATTEMPT DETECTED" with attacker IP information

Detailed logs capture timestamp, source IP, and attempted actions

System maintains normal operation while logging malicious activity
