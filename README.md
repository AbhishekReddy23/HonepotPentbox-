🐝 Honeypot with Pentbox on Kali Linux
Welcome to my comprehensive Pentbox Honeypot project! This guide demonstrates how to set up and use Pentbox on Kali Linux to create honeypots for network security testing. Perfect for cybersecurity enthusiasts and students learning penetration testing.

🛠️ What is Pentbox?
Pentbox is a Ruby-based security testing tool designed specifically for Kali Linux. It's a comprehensive penetration testing framework that helps identify vulnerabilities in networks and systems through various security testing modules including honeypots, port scanning, cryptography tools, and network analysis capabilities.

🎯 Why Use Pentbox and Honeypots?
Honeypots are decoy systems strategically deployed to attract and analyze attacker behavior. They serve multiple critical security purposes:

🕵️‍♂️ Attack Analysis: Reveal how hackers attempt to breach systems and what techniques they use

🛡️ Vulnerability Assessment: Help identify and fix security weaknesses in your actual network infrastructure

🎯 Threat Diversion: Distract attackers from your main production systems while gathering intelligence

📊 Security Intelligence: Collect valuable data about attack patterns and malicious activities

📝 Prerequisites
Before getting started with this project, ensure you have the following components ready:

🖥️ VirtualBox - For creating and managing virtual machine environments

🐧 Kali Linux - The primary operating system for this security testing setup

💎 Pentbox - The main security testing framework (we'll download this together)

🌐 Network Access - For testing network-based security features

📦 Download and Install Pentbox on Kali Linux
Pentbox is a Ruby-based application that offers various network and cryptographic functionalities. Here's the step-by-step installation process:

Installation Steps:
Open your terminal in Kali Linux

🧪 Testing and Validation
🐝 Honeypot Testing Methodology
To properly test your honeypot configuration:

Testing Steps:

Use a web browser or Telnet client to simulate intrusion attempts

Target the configured ports (default port 80 for fast setup)

Monitor the Kali terminal for real-time intrusion detection alerts

Analyze the logged data for attack patterns
